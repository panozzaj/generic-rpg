Things that we can work on:

 - a dude moving around on a landscape
 - eventing system on map
  - conversations
 - battles


 Technical debt
  - figure out a way to get both people with a valid git repository in floobits
  - pairing gem so it doesn't look like one person only worked on it (shipstars-ego.gem)
