Things that we can work on:

 - a dude moving around on a landscape
  - render background tiles
  - put avatar under map screen
  - render a map
  - sprite dude
  - some sort of bounds checking on landscape (or other screens)
  - center map around dude?
 - eventing system on map
  - conversations
 - screen modes
   - map
   - battle
   - menu
   - cutscene

 Nice-to-haves:
  - parallax scrolling of map backgrounds

 Technical debt
  - figure out a way to get both people with a valid git repository in floobits
  - pairing gem so it doesn't look like one person only worked on it (shipstars-ego.gem)
  - Need to have files / folders open in floobits for them to show up?
   - basically generated files are also not working correctly?

 Floobits-specific
  - having a tough time syncing things flawlessly
   - basically it looks like we are pulling in files from the workspace instead of using what is on disk (Vim)
   - or changes are not synced over to the workspace
   - especially when we build files?
