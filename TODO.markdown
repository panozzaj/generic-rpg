Things that we can work on:

 - a dude moving around on a landscape
  - some sort of bounds checking on landscape (or other screens)
  - center map around dude?
 - eventing system on map
  - conversations
 - battles
 - status screen


 Technical debt
  - figure out a way to get both people with a valid git repository in floobits
  - pairing gem so it doesn't look like one person only worked on it (shipstars-ego.gem)
  - Need to have files / folders open in floobits for them to show up?
   - basically generated files are also not working correctly?
